# Hypothesis Log

Append-only. Each experiment gets a card before any code runs — results are recorded after. Status: `Pending` → `Running` → `Confirmed` / `Rejected` / `Inconclusive`.

## How to use

1. Write the hypothesis card first (what we predict and why)
2. Define confirm/reject criteria upfront — do not adjust after seeing results
3. Lock the out-of-sample period — never touch it until in-sample is fully evaluated
4. Record actual results verbatim; add interpretation below

## H001 — ORB: H/L mode vs ATR mode, risk-adjusted performance on QQQ

**Date filed**: 2026-04-25
**Status**: REJECTED
**Strategy**: Opening Range Breakout (5-min opening range, enter bar 6)
**Asset**: QQQ
**In-sample**: 2016-01-01 → 2022-12-31
**Out-of-sample**: 2023-01-01 → 2026-04-25 (locked — do not evaluate until H001 in-sample verdict is final)

### Hypothesis

H/L-mode exits (stop at range H/L, 10R profit target) will produce a **higher Sharpe ratio** than ATR-mode exits (5% of 14-day ATR stop, close EOD) over the in-sample period on QQQ, because the defined reward structure prevents large drawdowns on winning days.

### Null hypothesis

There is no statistically significant difference in Sharpe ratio between the two exit modes (difference < 0.2).

### Confirm criteria (all must hold)

- Sharpe(H/L) > Sharpe(ATR) by ≥ 0.2
- Max drawdown(H/L) ≤ max drawdown(ATR)
- Win rate difference < 10% (ensuring it's not just cherry-picking winners)

### Reject criteria (any one sufficient)

- Sharpe(ATR) ≥ Sharpe(H/L)
- H/L max drawdown exceeds ATR max drawdown by > 5%
- Total trades < 200 (insufficient sample)

### Results

Run: 2026-04-25 | QQQ | In-sample 2016-01-01 → 2022-12-31 | Starting equity: $25,000

| Metric | H/L mode | ATR mode |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Trades | 157 | 155 |
| Win rate | 31.9% | 12.3% |
| Avg win | $692 | $1,464 |
| Avg loss | -$263 | -$120 |
| Profit factor | 1.23 | 1.71 |
| **Sharpe** | **1.405** | **2.047** |
| Max drawdown | -13.2% | -11.2% |
| Calmar | 3.38 | 7.62 |
| Total return | 25.8% | 46.0% |
| Final equity | $31,459 | $36,505 |
| Exit breakdown | stop:102, eod:55 | stop:136, eod:19 |

**Verdict: REJECTED** — ATR mode is superior across all metrics. Sharpe difference = -0.642 (needed ≥ +0.200 to confirm).

### Interpretation

The hypothesis was wrong — ATR mode doesn't just match H/L, it clearly dominates. The key insight is the **asymmetry profile**:
- ATR mode wins only 12.3% of the time but average win ($1,464) dwarfs average loss ($120) — a 12:1 ratio
- This is a classic trend-following payoff: take many small losses, ride the occasional big breakout
- H/L mode's 10R target is too restrictive — it cuts winners that could run further, while the ATR stop is tighter on losses

**Note on regime breakdown**: All 157 trades fell in expansion regime. The 2020 recession (NBER: Feb–Apr 2020, 2 months) produced too few ORB signals to register in the regime grouping. H002 will need a broader contraction definition (e.g., 12-month SMA of FRED Industrial Production) to get meaningful sample sizes.

## H002 — ORB: ATR mode performs better in contraction regimes

**Date filed**: 2026-04-25
**Status**: Pending (awaiting H001 completion)
**Strategy**: ORB, ATR-mode exits only
**Asset**: QQQ
**Regimes**: NBER expansion vs contraction (FRED USREC series)

### Hypothesis

ATR-mode exits outperform H/L-mode on a risk-adjusted basis during **NBER contraction periods**, because elevated volatility in contractions makes fixed R-multiple targets unrealistic while EOD exits limit overnight gap risk.

### Confirm criteria

- Sharpe(ATR, contraction) > Sharpe(H/L, contraction) by ≥ 0.15
- At least 20 trading days in contraction regime within in-sample period

### Reject criteria

- Sharpe(H/L, contraction) ≥ Sharpe(ATR, contraction)
- Fewer than 20 contraction days in sample

## H003 — ORB: edge is leverage-dependent (TQQQ > QQQ > SPY)

**Date filed**: 2026-04-25
**Status**: Pending

### Hypothesis

ORB Sharpe ratio is higher on leveraged products (TQQQ) than the underlying (QQQ, SPY) because the wider daily ranges on leveraged ETFs make the opening range breakout signal more significant relative to noise.

### Confirm criteria

- Sharpe(TQQQ) > Sharpe(QQQ) > Sharpe(SPY), all using same exit mode
- All three have total trades > 200

### Reject criteria

- Order does not hold (e.g. QQQ > TQQQ)
- Any asset has fewer than 200 trades

## H004 — ORB: edge decays post-2022 (out-of-sample test)

**Date filed**: 2026-04-25
**Status**: Pending (requires H001 in-sample to be confirmed first)

### Hypothesis

ORB Sharpe ratio in the out-of-sample period (2023–2026) is materially lower than in-sample (2016–2022), indicating strategy crowding or regime change post-COVID.

### Confirm criteria

- Sharpe(out-of-sample) < Sharpe(in-sample) × 0.7

### Reject criteria

- Out-of-sample Sharpe within 30% of in-sample Sharpe
